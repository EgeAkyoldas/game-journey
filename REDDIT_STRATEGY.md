> A step-by-step plan to share the app across Reddit without getting flagged as spam.

## Core Rules

1. **Never post to multiple subreddits on the same day**
2. **Engage genuinely** in each community before and after posting
3. **Adapt the message** to each subreddit's culture and audience
4. **Cross-post when possible** instead of creating duplicate posts (shows transparency)
5. **Reply to every comment** you receive within the first few hours

---

## Phase 1: RDR Communities (Days 1-7)

These are your primary audience. They already care about RDR2.

### r/reddeadredemption (~2M members)
- **Status:** Already posted and approved
- **Action:** Engage with comments, answer questions

### r/RDR2 (~500K members)
- **When:** Day 3-4
- **Method:** Cross-post your original r/reddeadredemption post
- **Why cross-post:** It's transparent, links back to original discussion, less likely to be flagged

### r/reddeadredemption2 (~200K members)
- **When:** Day 6-7
- **Method:** Cross-post your original post
- **Same reasoning as above**

---

## Phase 2: Broader Gaming Communities (Days 10-20)

These audiences are larger but less targeted. Your post needs a different angle.

### r/patientgamers (~1.5M members)
- **When:** Day 10-12
- **Method:** New text post (not cross-post)
- **Angle:** "Late completionist" story — this community loves people who revisit older games
- **Title idea:** `Finally going for 100% in RDR2 years later, so I built a tracking tool`
- **Body:** Focus on the journey and experience, mention the tool naturally at the end

### r/gaming (~40M members)
- **When:** Day 15-17
- **Method:** Image post with screenshot of the app
- **Angle:** Visual-first — this sub is driven by images and short posts
- **Title idea:** `I built a free checklist for tracking RDR2 100% completion`
- **Body:** Keep it very short, link in first comment
- **Tip:** Post between 14:00-18:00 UTC (peak US hours)

### r/Games (~4M members)
- **When:** Day 18-20
- **Method:** Self-post (text)
- **Angle:** More technical — this community appreciates effort and detail
- **Note:** Strict self-promotion rules, make sure you've commented elsewhere in the sub first

---

## Phase 3: Niche & Tool Communities (Days 25+)

Smaller but highly engaged audiences who appreciate this type of work.

### r/gamedev (~1.5M members)
- **When:** Day 25+
- **Method:** New text post
- **Angle:** "How I built it" — focus on the development process, tech stack, data verification
- **Title idea:** `I built a vanilla JS checklist app for RDR2 completionists`
- **Body:** Talk about the tech decisions, data verification against multiple sources, localStorage strategy

### r/webdev (~2M members)
- **When:** Day 28+
- **Method:** New text post
- **Angle:** Technical showcase — vanilla JS, Vite, offline-first, no framework
- **Title idea:** `No React, no framework — built a full checklist app with vanilla JS and Vite`

### r/SideProject (~200K members)
- **When:** Day 30+
- **Method:** New text post
- **Angle:** "Weekend project that grew" — this sub loves passion projects
- **Title idea:** `Built a free RDR2 100% completion tracker as a side project`

## Comment Strategy (Ongoing)

The most effective long-term strategy. Search these terms in RDR subreddits weekly:

| Search Term | Where to Search | What to Do |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| "100% completion" | r/reddeadredemption, r/RDR2 | Offer tips + mention tool |
| "missable content" | r/reddeadredemption | Warn about missables + link |
| "checklist" | r/reddeadredemption | Direct answer |
| "going for platinum" | r/Trophies | Help with strategy + link |
| "gambler challenge" | r/reddeadredemption | Empathize + mention tool |

**Comment template (adapt each time):**
```
[Answer their specific question first]

I actually built a free checklist for tracking all of this 
if it helps: https://rdr2-journey.netlify.app/
```

**Never** copy-paste the same comment. Always answer the actual question first, then mention the tool naturally.

## What NOT to Do

- Do not post to more than 1 subreddit per day
- Do not use the exact same title across subreddits
- Do not ignore comments on your posts
- Do not post only self-promotion content on your account
- Do not repost if a post gets removed — message mods instead
