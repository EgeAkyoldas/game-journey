Hey Outlaws, 

I was going for 100% and couldn't find a checklist that suits my western drifter vibe :) , saves progress automatically, and didn't require an account. So I built one.

**Link:** https://rdr2-journey.netlify.app/

**What's included:**

- All 90 Challenges (Bandit, Explorer, Gambler, Herbalist, etc.)
- All Stranger Missions with step-by-step guides
- All 16 Legendary Animals + 13 Legendary Fish
- All Collectibles (144 Cigarette Cards, 30 Dinosaur Bones, 20 Dreamcatchers, etc.)
- Treasure Hunt solutions
- Missable content warnings by chapter
- Camp upgrades and satchel crafting guides

**Features:**

- Works completely offline after first load
- Saves progress in your browser (no account)
- Export/Import to backup or transfer between devices
- Region and chapter filtering
- Mobile responsive

**Quick tip for newcomers:** Hunt the Legendary Buck first (west of Strawberry). The Buck Antler Trinket you craft from it increases pelt quality for your entire playthrough.
